# TF-IDF-Map-Reduce

# Overview
The subject TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) consists in calculating the TF-IDF score for each word in a set of documents, for each document. We must provide 2 types of implementation for the MapReduce algorithm that will allow the calculation of the TF-IDF score:
- Map Reduce Python Hadoop Streaming
- Spark

The aim is to perform an experimental analysis to compare the performance of 2 implementations. To do this, we will perform a scalability test (the ability of a product to adapt to a change in the order of magnitude of demand) to compare the performance of the 2 implementations.
